# brunswick-mongodb

Attempt at implementing MongoDB to existing project (Brunswick order app).

## Installation

1. Clone

2. npm i

3. Create MongoDB DB and create a collection called 'menus' and populate documents with info in file "MongoDB-documents.json"

4. Create .env file with MongoDB DB login eg:

DB = "mongodb://<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>@ds111765.mlab.com:11765/brunswick"

5. To run: npm start

## Notes

Requires a complete refactor, code was taken from a previous weekend project (2.5 days) from bootcamp where we were midway learning React and Restful API's/PostGres. Parts are broken, Styling only for mobile - also quite scrappy.

This project was solely created to understand/learn about MongoDb and Mongoose.
